              <p>
                DEI initiatives were born out of a realization that an
                unconscious bias often pervades corporate hiring, with their
                intention being the foundation of a more inclusive and diverse
                workplace. In this article, we&apos;ll look at DEI data and
                demonstrate how you can use it during your hiring process.

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                DEI is an acronym that stands for diversity, equity, and
                inclusion. These metrics are vital when building and maintaining
                a thriving workplace, providing everyone a fair opportunity
                within the working world, no matter their social background,
                sexuality, gender, or ethnicity.
                <br />
                <br />
                DEI and DEI data have become increasingly public over the past
                years, especially after a 2014 report. Large tech companies like
                Google, Facebook, and Apple released their diversity reports.
                These reports revealed a significant underrepresentation of
                black and Hispanic employees.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although these initial reports came out almost ten years ago,
                the lack of representation and equal access to industry
                positions hasn&apos;t seen much progress. A 2019 report revealed
                that people of color constituted only{" "}

                What&apos;s the difference between diversity, equity, and

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                These three terms are frequently mixed up, with people using
                them interchangeably when, in fact, they&apos;re not the same
                thing. Let&apos;s break them down:
              </p>

              <ul className="mw-560 ahl">
                <li>
                  Diversity - Diversity is anything that sets two people apart.
                  This could be gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or even
                  native language or political orientation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Equity - Equity is the act of giving people equal access by
                  providing tailored resources that take into account their
                  starting position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Inclusion - Inclusion is a principle where individuals are
                  treated with fairness, kindness, and respect.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">What is DEI Data?</h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                DEI data compiles information about demographics in business.
                From the diversity of the applicant pool to a national average
                percentage of a particular minority in a specific role,
                everything is taken into account to ensure different
                demographics are adequately represented in the workforce and
                management.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, some DEI data will look at financial figures and
                how different demographics are compensated for doing the same
                job. This extends even into leadership positions, with DEI data
                revealing the makeup of upper management.
                <br />
                <br />
                The central focus of DEI data is to inspire diversity and alert
                businesses when their bias is leading to the under-hiring of
                minorities in their recruitment processes.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">Why DEI data is essential.</h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                Without data, a project striving for DEI has no clear metrics
                for tracking or goals to strive toward. There are two primary
                sources of data to draw from when creating a DEI program:
              </p>

              <ul className="mw-560 ahl">
                <li>
                  Internal data - The survey of your current workforce that
                  establishes current DEI with concrete statistics from your
                  workplace profile.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <Link href="/diversitydata" className="link alt">
                    <a className="link alt">
                      External data - The more important of the two data sets,
                      external data allows you to establish if you are in line
                      with the local or national average for particular
                      diversity demographics.
                    </a>
                  </Link>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                By taking internal surveys and comparing them to the DEI
                national or local data for your area, you&apos;ll then be able
                to understand how DEI currently stands in your workplace. More
                often than not, conducting this comparison will lead hiring
                managers to realize that they need to improve upon DEI in the
                workplace.
                <br />
                <br />
                The DEI assessment will place these data sets into the
                conversation, looking at DEI differences to illustrate the
                current extent of diversity in the workplace.

                Develop effective DEI Recruiting Initiatives and Practices
              </h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                When attempting to develop DEI within recruiting, there are
                three individual stages that you need to focus on. Each of these
                has different initiatives and practices that you can put to work
                to create a more DEI-friendly recruiting process.
                <br />
                <br />
                These three stages are:
              </p>

              <ul className="mw-560 ahl">
                <li>Creating diversity in sourcing</li>
                <li>Increasing diversity in candidate screening</li>
                <li>Boosting diversity in both shortlisting and hiring</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                Let&apos;s discuss some methods you can bring to your hiring and
                interview processes.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">Sourcing</h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                Sourcing is the process of ensuring that a diverse range of
                people apply to any job posting that your hiring managers put
                out.
                <br />
                <br />
                One primary way of increasing the amount of diversity within
                your talent pool is by directly targeting diverse candidates.
                You could now reach out to the target candidates and urge them
                to apply. This tactic is extensively used in technology, with
                Women in Coding being a critical demographic target of this
                recruitment drive.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another possibility to increase the amount of diversity in your
                sourcing process is to offer internships directly to specific
                communities, helping them get into the field. Even if
                they&apos;re not an excellent fit for your company, offering
                internships will help further open doors for them in the future
                and contribute to a more diverse talent pool for the future.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">Candidate Screening</h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                One of the best ways to eliminate bias and boost the diversity
                of candidates through the screening process is by using blind
                resumes. By taking off personal information, like names, date of
                birth, and gender, you instantly inspire a screening process
                that only looks at what matters - experience and qualifications.
                <br />
                <br />
                Additionally, you can use blind interviews, proposing text-based
                questions to potential hires and allowing them an equal amount
                of time to respond to them. There are also AI software
                applications in this modern age that you can use to collect, and
                screen resumes automatically, further taking human bias out of
                the picture.
              </p>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">Shortlisting and Hiring</h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                At this point in the process, if you have followed the first two
                stages, you should already have a much more diverse talent pool.
                One of the best strategies to ensure that various candidates
                have a better chance of getting hired is by providing that there
                is as high a percentage as possible of diverse candidates in the
                final selection pool.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another significant step you can take is to hire a head of DEI
                in your business, which can then take over on this final stage.
                Bringing in a hiring manager who has experience working in DEI
                and doesn&apos;t know any of the candidates will make the final
                decision much fairer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Although this process isn&apos;t perfect, actively striving to
                create a more diverse workplace is a great place to start.
              </p>

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                As DEI becomes ever more present in the minds of hiring managers
                around the globe, new data-driven solutions have begun to spring

                into what current DEI benchmarks look like for specific roles.
                By performing a candidate pool demographic scan, you&apos;ll be
                able to more accurately use data to find areas where diversity
                can be improved in your system.

                The actionable demographic information sets Horsefly apart from
                other labor market data platforms, allowing you to take the data

                How to use DEI data when recruiting and interviewing candidates
              </h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                Data is the central key to creating an effective DEI program.
                Without benchmarks that demonstrate the national average for
                specific roles or positions, you&apos;ll have nothing to compare
                your company to. Equally, when looking internally, DEI data
                allows you to realize if you&apos;re on track to create a
                diverse workplace.
                <br />
                <br />
                When looking to create an effective DEI program, you should
                focus on three steps:

              <p className="mw-560 ahl">Let&apos;s break these down further.</p>

              <h4 className="mw-560 ahl bold">
                Developing a hiring plan that takes into account DEI
              </h4>
              <p className="mw-560 ahl">
                Information is the central pillar upon which great DEI hiring
                stands. One of the first steps, when you&apos;re developing a
                hiring plan, is to consult national labor statistics to look at
                benchmarks your business should be striving towards.
                <br />
                <br />
                These comprehensive datasets will give you a national or
                international view of how ethnicity and demographic data are
                displayed. You&apos;ll then be able to hone in on your area to
                set more realistic targets for your business.
                <br />
                <br />
                When crafting your job postings, consider amplifying the range
                you send them. Instead of posting to just LinkedIn, think about
                placing job notices in locations where a more diverse selection
                of individuals will see them.

                Another way that you can ensure your hiring process is more
                favorable to DEI is to ensure that the team that&apos;s doing
                the hiring is diverse. Creating a diverse leadership will ensure
                that hiring is also more varied and further inspire a broader
                pool of applicants.

                Once you&apos;ve looked internally, you can also use external
                DEI statistics to compare your business to external labor market
                data. This allows you to gauge if you&apos;re doing enough to
                stay ahead of the broader labor market. If your company is
                falling below national averages, you should change your process.
