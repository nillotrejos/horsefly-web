              <h2>Scope</h2>

              <p>
                The scope of this privacy policy covers all personal data of
                natural persons held by Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd whether
                or not the information was provided by the natural person.
                <br />
                <br />
                The CEO of Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd will coordinate the
                effort of the following disciplines to implement of this policy:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Information Security</li>
                <li>Enterprise Architecture and Design</li>
                <li>Assurance and Quality Management</li>
                <li>Information Management</li>
                <li>Legal</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <br />
                <br />
                In respect of the protection of personal data in particular, the
                lead compliance agency that Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd will
                draw guidance from is the UK Information Commissioner&apos;s
                Office. Those responsible for privacy governance will be
                contacted, in the event of conflict of any interest, need for
                specific advice or uncertainty for guidance to resolve such
                matters.
              </p>

              <hr id="governance" />
              <h2>Corporate Governance</h2>

              <p>
                GDPR legislation requires that there is an identifiable
                management structure which will ensure that data management
                policy is defined, applied and has the appropriate governance
                regime in place which can ensure the integrity of data holdings.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd will therefore institute a Data
                Protection Committee which will meet, initially quarterly, to
                discuss refinement of this policy document and its associated
                governance regime. The membership of the board will vary from
                time to time as the working situation demands it, with the
                committee having the authority to call on specific expertise
                from across the company as need demands. The permanent members
                of the Data Protection Committee will be:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
                <li>Head of Development</li>
                <li>
                  Person fulfilling the role of Data Protection Officer in a
                  part time capacity.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                <br />
                <br />
                The CEO has ultimate responsibility for personal data protection
                and will delegate operation of the policy to the DPO.
                <br />
                <br />
                This committee will be responsible for conduct and recording the
                results of an annual privacy risk assessment and audit. This
                audit will record the information about the data held including
                its source, the processing undertaken and the basis for doing
                so.
                <br />
                <br />
                The committee will also ensure the following by design and
                policy:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Processing is limited and specific</li>
                <li>Data is secure</li>
                <li>
                  Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd’s registration with the ICO
                  remains current
                </li>
                <li>
                  Privacy procedures are implemented by design and default
                </li>
                <li>
                  {" "}
                  Data is kept up to date including ensuring that any database
                  containing personal data reflects current source data as soon
                  as possible and the requisite levels of consent are still
                  applicable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Data Protection requirements are fully considered when
                  proposing and designing new products, services, business
                  systems, marketing methods and databases.

              <p>
                The overarching data management principle for Ai Recruitment
                Technologies Ltd is:
                <br />
                <br />
                The recording of the minimum data, for the minimum period of
                time to maximum effect held securely such that integrity is
                maintained and verification can be proved if necessary in a
                manner that is legally sound on an end to end through life
                basis.
                <br />
                <br />

              <h2>Compliance Process</h2>

              <h3 className="first">Background</h3>
              <p>
                Ai Recruitment Technologies Ltd has developed big data and AI
                driven talent analytics products and services which drive fast
                and informed recruitment.
              </p>

              <h3>Wammee 1.0</h3>
              <p>
                The company’s original product Wammee 1.0 used personal data and
                would be subject to GDPR legislation. Wammee 1.0 was
                discontinued on the 24th May 2018. Any client with remaining
                email marketing credits was moved to Wammee 2.0.
              </p>

              <h3>Horsefly 1.0</h3>
              <p>
                The company launched Horsefly in late 2016. Using anonymous data
                of millions of profiles obtained online, Horsefly can provide
                essential strategic and tactical information to make the
                recruitment process much more efficient.
                <br />
                <br />
                As Horsefly uses anonymous data obtained from the Internet, it
                is not subject to GDPR.
                <br />
                <br />
                Any other potential identifier fields are kept anonymous by
                using pseudonymisation. Two way encryption is used to ensure
                data cannot be reversed engineered back into personal data
                without the secure encryption key. The source encryption key is
                only available to the head of development.
              </p>

              <h3>Wammee 2.0</h3>
              <p>
                Wammee 2.0 is used by client companies to advertise employment
                roles within their businesses. Using the insights obtained
                through Horsefly we are able to optimise the keywords to create
                custom audiences and broadcast by using the Facebook, Instagram
                and Twitter advertising API. Personal data is not used by Ai
                Recruitment Technologies Ltd in this process and therefore
                Wammee 2.0 is not subject to GDPR.
              </p>

              <h3>CareerMatter.io</h3>
              <p>
                The Horsefly data can be used to drive a candidate facing career
                advice platform. Access to this platform is being and will
                continue to be offered to all natural persons who wish to use
                the platform, such persons will provide relevant personal data
                directly.
                <br />
                <br />
                This database which is called Wammee DB will contain data of
                natural persons who have provided personal data by actively
                signing up and providing relevant personal data directly and it

              <hr id="encryption" />
              <h2>The Use of Encryption</h2>
              <p>
                Where possible, the use of encryption in respect of the
                protection of the integrity of personal data is to be
                encouraged. The deployment and subsequent use of encryption
                facilities is to be managed by the company Head of Development
                taking into account the need to protect personal data as advised
                by the company DPO appointee.
              </p>

              <h3>As Controller to Third Parties</h3>
              <p>
                In the event that personal data is passed to third parties for
                ongoing processing, the controller is the company. However, all
                such operational requirements will be subject to contract and
                monitored, from an assurance perspective, such that company
                compliance with personal data protection is not compromised in
                any way.
                <br />
                <br />
                The development and construction of such contracts particularly
                those that contain personal data will be subject to the scrutiny
                and approval of the company legal representatives, the DPO and
                the Chief Executive Officer. Such contracts will be subject to
                regular review.
                <br />
                <br />
                Particular care in such contractual arrangements must be taken
                in respect of breach reporting and in the circumstances of a
                breach ensure that both the company and the authorities are
                informed of such things within the time limits specified by the
                UK Information Commissioner.

                <br />
                <br />
                The company may collect this information in a variety of ways.
                For example, data might be collected through application forms,
                CVs or resumes; obtained from your passport or other identity
                documents such as your driving licence; from forms completed by
                you at the start of or during employment (such as benefit
                nomination forms); from correspondence with you; or through
                interviews, meetings or other assessments.
                <br />
                <br />
                In some cases, the company may collect personal data about you
                from third parties, such as references supplied by former
                employers, information from employment background check
                providers, information from credit reference agencies and
                information from criminal records checks permitted by law.
                <br />
                <br />
                Data will be stored in a range of different places, including in
                your personnel file, in the company&apos;s HR management systems
                and in other IT systems including the company&apos;s email
                system.
              </p>

              <h3>Why does the company process personal data?</h3>
              <p>
                The company needs to process data to enter into an employment
                contract with you and to meet its obligations under your
                employment contract. For example, it needs to process your data
                to provide you with an employment contract, to pay you in
                accordance with your employment contract and to administer
                benefit, pension and insurance entitlements.
                <br />
                <br />
                In some cases, the company needs to process data to ensure that
                it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is
                required to check an employee&apos;s entitlement to work in the
                UK, to deduct tax, to comply with health and safety laws and to
                enable employees to take periods of leave to which they are
                entitled.
                <br />
                <br />
                In other cases, the company has a legitimate interest in
                processing personal data before, during and after the end of the
                employment relationship. Processing employee data allows the
                company to:
                <br />
                <br />
              </p>

              <ul>

                <li>
                  maintain accurate and up-to-date employment records and

                <li>
                  operate and keep a record of absence and absence management
                  procedures, to allow effective workforce management and ensure

                  which they are entitled;
                </li>

                <li>

                  with duties in relation to individuals with disabilities, meet
                  its obligations under health and safety law, and ensure that
                  employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which
                  they are entitled;
                </li>

                  maternity, paternity, adoption, parental and shared parental
                  leave), to allow effective workforce management, to ensure
                  that the company complies with duties in relation to leave
                  entitlement, and to ensure that employees are receiving the
                  pay or other benefits to which they are entitled;
                </li>

                <li>

                <li>maintain and promote equality in the workplace.</li>

              <p>
                <br />
                <br />
                Some special categories of personal data, such as information
                about health or medical conditions, is processed to carry out
                employment law obligations (such as those in relation to
                employees with disabilities).
                <br />
                <br />
                Where the company processes other special categories of personal
                data, such as information about ethnic origin, sexual
                orientation, health or religion or belief, this is done for the
                purposes of equal opportunities monitoring. Data that the
                company uses for these purposes is anonymised or is collected
                with the express consent of employees, which can be withdrawn at
                any time. Employees are entirely free to decide whether or not
                to provide such data and there are no consequences of failing to
                do so.
              </p>

              <h3>Who has access to data?</h3>
              <p>
                Your information may be shared internally, including with
                members of the HR and recruitment team (including payroll), your
                line manager, managers in the business area in which you work
                and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for performance
                of their roles.
                <br />
                <br />
                The company shares your data with third parties in order to
                obtain pre-employment references from other employers, obtain
                employment background checks from third-party providers and
                obtain necessary criminal records checks from the Disclosure and
                Barring Service. The company may also share your data with third
                parties in the context of a sale of some or all of its business.
                In those circumstances the data will be subject to
                confidentiality arrangements.
                <br />
                <br />
                The company may also shares your data with third parties that
                process data on its behalf, in connection with payroll, the
                provision of benefits and the provision of occupational health
                services.
                <br />
                <br />
                The company will not transfer your data to countries outside the
                European Economic Area.
              </p>

              <h3>How does the company protect data?</h3>
              <p>
                The company takes the security of your data seriously. The
                company has internal policies and controls in place to try to
                ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed,
                misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by its
                employees in the performance of their duties.
                <br />
                <br />
                Where the company engages third parties to process personal data
                on its behalf, they do so on the basis of written instructions,
                are under a duty of confidentiality and are obliged to implement
                appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the
                security of data.
              </p>

              <h3>For how long does the company keep data?</h3>
              <p>
                The company will hold your personal data for the duration of
                your employment. The periods for which your data is held after
                the end of employment are the end of the first full financial
                year following the end of your employment.

              <p>
                You have some obligations under your employment contract to
                provide the company with data. In particular, you are required
                to report absences from work and may be required to provide
                information about disciplinary or other matters under the
                implied duty of good faith. You may also have to provide the
                company with data in order to exercise your statutory rights,
                such as in relation to statutory leave entitlements. Failing to
                provide the data may mean that you are unable to exercise your
                statutory rights.
                <br />
                <br />
                Certain information, such as contact details, your right to work
                in the UK and payment details, have to be provided to enable the
                company to enter a contract of employment with you. If you do
                not provide other information, this will hinder the
                company&apos;s ability to administer the rights and obligations
                arising as a result of the employment relationship efficiently.
              </p>

              <h3>Automated decision-making</h3>
              <p>
                Employment decisions are not based solely on automated
                decision-making.
